emacsd
======

.emacs.d directory for fast bringup of emacs on a new linux computer. Most initialization done in literate .org file. Proxying is done in init.el.
There must not be another emacs initialization file to be loaded, or conflicts may occur. The elpa directory contains use-package, essential for full bringup.
